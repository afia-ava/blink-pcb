## Entry 3
I measured the PCB's component placements and drew sketches on the box with those measurements. Next I'll be working on extruding these and some sort of hinges to support opening and closing of the case. 

## Entry 2
I have been working on creating a case for the PCB and will hopefully decorate it somehow. I've CAD modelled the basic version of a box and need to make opening holes for the PCB components as well as hinges to make the box open and close.

## Entry 1
I soldered this blink PCB from a kit. It has 3 LED lights, 3 resistros, and 3 switches. There's no differences in current for the resistors. I also added a battery in the case.
